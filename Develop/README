# Note-Taker
About: This is an application that helps take and keep notes.

Description: The application allows the user to take notes to keep track of their todos and then deletet them when they are completed.

Challenges: The challenges I had was getting the app deployed to Heroku.

Future Development: For future development I want the user to be able to put the notes in different lists, maybe by day or time.

Motivation: My motivation was to make an application where people can put all their notes and todos in one spot. Easy to create and delete.

Success:I was getting errors and realized I had not installed everything I needed. I am getting a little better at reading the errors and fixing the problems.

Contributors: I used the starter code from class and then added or changed different aspects to make it mine.
